# Sprites Documentation

> Sprites are persistent, hardware-isolated execution environments for arbitrary code. Unlike traditional serverless functions, Sprites are stateful Linux computers that maintain their filesystem and state between runs.

Sprites is a product by Fly.io that provides instant, secure sandboxes for AI agents and untrusted code execution.

## Key Features

- Persistent ext4 filesystem that survives hibernation
- Automatic hibernation after inactivity (no compute charges when idle)
- Instant wake from hibernation
- Hardware-level isolation via Firecracker microVMs
- HTTP access via unique URLs
- Checkpoint and restore capabilities

## Use Cases

- AI Code Execution: Execute code generated by language models in isolated, secure environments
- Untrusted Code: Create isolated environments for running user-submitted code safely
- Development Environments: Build persistent dev environments that maintain state
- Long-lived Services: Run services with automatic hibernation and wake-on-request
- CI/CD Tasks: Test code against live git repositories with full environment access
